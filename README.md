Sorry to make this useless PR, but I couldn't manage it to contact you on different ways (no DMs on Github,..), so I hope I can reach you here :D

Could you maybe edit your post here: https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/1209 and tell me where you put the C & .h files? I'm trying to do the same, but can't figure it out! Thank you very much!!!
